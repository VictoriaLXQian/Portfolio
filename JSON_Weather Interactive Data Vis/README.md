#### This is a project using JSON weather data from darksky API. This piece visualizes the temperature(in Celsius) and UV index of five cities based on my travel frequency. This is served as a personalized weather app to help myself pack more efficient.     

1. Temperature in Celsius. The screen is scale from 0 to 50 degree. 
2. Using lowest and highest temperature of the day to plot a temperature line. It is easy to tell the temperature difference in spite of the high and low of the day.
3. The average temperature of the day decides the intensity of the color of the line. 
4. Color coded: ORANGE = Above zero; Blue = Below zero. 
5. UV Index (0-10), is represented by color RED with different percentage of transparency. The higher the uv index, the closer it is to red. (This is useful when packing, so I would easily know whether I need to bring sunscreen products.)
6. The top city listed is where I am currently. The rest four places are based on my travel frequency. 
    (Raleigh > Hong Kong > Milan > Minneapolis)
7. Click on the city will provide a summary of today and timezone info. The background color of this window indicates whether it is daytime or not. (sunrise<daytime<sunset)
