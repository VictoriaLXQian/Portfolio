#### Sound recorded and edited by myself.

This is a continuation of last week's animiation of a face with different emotions with the sound added. All sound are recorded and edited by myself. A sound of a metronome is used for the happy face jumping around the screen. To add a dramatic effect of the moving tear, I use the sound of raindrops hitting the ground to the sad face. The sound for the surprised face and angry are a ring hiting a glass bowl and advancing the film in a lomo Diane camera.
